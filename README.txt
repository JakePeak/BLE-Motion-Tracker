BLE Motion Tracker
==========================================

This is a 200+ hour personal project with the purpose of plotting a live
graph of the current location of the motion tracker.  This was accomplished
through Bluetooth LE communications, Inertial Measurement Unit position
approximations, and python's matplotlib plotting capabilities.

This is truly a full-stack project; it scales all levels of design from custom
PCB design and manufacturing to developing a full user interface.  Almost all
code was written in C/C++, with a little python.  At the heart of this
project's functionality lies the BlueNRG M2SA module, which was used to
opperate the PCB and run all bluetooth communications with the host computer.

Throughout this project, I have picked up many skills.  These are all 
documented with their respect parts of the project, located throughout this 
repository.  As well, some of the most time-consuming bugs and errors I 
encountered are documented for any who stumble upon this project when searching
for solutions to these bugs like I have.

For more information on each individual sub-component of this project, look
for the respective README files in that location of the repository.

If you have any questions, I would love to answer them.  Attached is my
