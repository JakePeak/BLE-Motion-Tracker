PCB Mounting
===================================

This file contains the SolidWorks CAD documents used to produce the casing
for the PCB.  This was a rather simple construction, with attention to detail
to reduce the need for supports for 3d prints and make resource-efficient 
joining methods between different parts.  As well, a laser cutter was
used to cut out a plexiglass cap for the mount to leave the circuit on
display, since it was the heart of the project.  A final render is included
in this folder, as well as documents for laser cutting.
